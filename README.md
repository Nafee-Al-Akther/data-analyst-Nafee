Descriptive Statistics:

Summary of turbidity values: minimum, average, and trends relative to temperature. Identifying patterns in water quality through statistical measures. Comparative analysis of seasonal variations in turbidity and temperature fluctuations across different geo-local areas. Identification of outlier values that could indicate errors in data collection or significant water quality anomalies.

Phase 2

Project Title: Diagnostic Analysis of Water System Issues in Vancouver

Objective: CConduct a diagnostic analysis of the water system in Vancouver to identify underlying issues affecting water quality and system infrastructure. This includes examining active and inactive mechanical systems, assessing permit renewal trends, and ensuring proper security and governance measures for data integrity. The goal is to develop actionable strategies to improve overall system reliability and prevent potential water quality crises.

Dataset:

Water System Data: Information on geolocal are maximum turbifity and temperature.
